  <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
Currently completing my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C01) and have AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C03) certificate lined up in the coming months. Successfully passed Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) first time with a score of 889. I have 10 years work experience in a previous industry and have decided to move to a job in cloud computing for a few reasons; I love being involved with the tech industry, I enjoy learning new skills and want to make sure I evolve with the times.
From December 2022 to July 2023 I have been travelling around Asia and Africa.</p>
